- [Makefile] Should the default target be m68k if `uname -m` == m68k?
- Test suite, add to list of test suites in Makefile
- Figure out what the hell are MAKESURE's and add them back if needed

- Pass that deals w/ 64-bit temporaries by transforming them into pairs of
  32-bit temporaries


- Optimizations:
  - Use `moveq`/`addq`/`subq` where applicable
  - Use builtin mul where possible
  - Use builtin div where possible
  - Use `movem` to save/load registers when entering/leaving a subroutine
